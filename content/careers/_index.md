### ZOZO Technologies, Inc.

I was in charge of designing and operating a web and machine learning platform centered on AWS and GCP. At GCP, we carried out a wide range of activities from the introduction of Terraform to the introduction of infrastructure CI to the production of Kubernetes by ourselves, and while spreading information to the team, we cultivated knowledge of production operation. Using the knowledge gained from the machine learning platform acquired through GCP as a weapon, we also proposed design and technical policies as a platform for use in replacement at AWS EKS.
